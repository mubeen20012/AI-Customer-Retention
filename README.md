# 📊 AI Customer Retention & Revenue Intelligence
### *End-to-End AI System for Churn Prediction & Revenue Optimization*

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**AI Customer Retention & Revenue Intelligence** is a production-ready system designed to prevent customer churn and maximize revenue for subscription-based businesses. This project goes beyond simple prediction by integrating **Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Explainable AI (XAI)** into a single unified pipeline.

Instead of just identifying "who" will leave, this system explains **why**, quantifies the **financial impact**, and provides **automated business recommendations**.

---

## 🚀 Key Business Intelligence
* **Churn Prediction:** Identifying high-risk customers before they leave.
* **Revenue Forecasting:** Estimating the monthly revenue value per customer.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers by behavior and value.
* **Actionable Insights:** Converting ML outputs into "Next-Best-Action" strategies.
* **Explainability:** Using **SHAP** to make black-box models transparent.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 1️⃣ Churn Classification (Gradient Boosting)
* **Goal:** Predict probability of churn (1 or 0).
* **Performance:** ~81% Accuracy | ~71% Recall.
* **Handling Imbalance:** Optimized using **SMOTE** and **GridSearchCV**.

### 2️⃣ Revenue Regression (Linear Pipeline)
* **Goal:** Quantify the financial value of each customer.
* **Performance:** R² Score: **0.9989** | MAE: ~0.75.

### 3️⃣ Customer Clustering (K-Means)
* **Goal:** Group customers into 4 actionable segments.
* **Technique:** Optimized via Elbow Method and visualized using **PCA**.

### 4️⃣ Explainable AI (SHAP)
* **Goal:** Global and local interpretability to understand top churn drivers (Tenure, Contract Type, Monthly Charges).
